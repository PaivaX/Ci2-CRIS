# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  aboutcenter: "<p>The Smart Cities Research Center (Ci2) is a multidisciplinary research group of the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar, and its integrated members come mainly from the areas of Computer Science, Electric and Electronic Engineering, Control, Communications, Chemical Technology and Applied Mathematics. Furthermore, collaborating members enable the Ci2 Unit to create links with other national Research Units, such as ISR and INESC-TEC, as well as international institutes, such as the Tallaght Institute of Technology - Ireland and IBM Research - Ireland. The Ci2 Unit benefits from the privileged relations between the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar and companies that play an important role on the practical deployment of smart city solutions, such as the Portuguese companies Compta, Critical Software and Sketchpixel and the multinational IBM.</p><p>Ci2 is a research unit funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) UIDB/05567/2020.</p>"
